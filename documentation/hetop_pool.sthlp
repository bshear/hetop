{title:Description}

{pstd}
This program estimates group means and standard deviations based on ordered frequency counts using a heteroskedastic ordered probit (HETOP) model framework. 

{pstd}
Estimation of group means and standard deviations is carried out by {bf: hetop_pool} assuming the cutscores between ordered categories are already known.

{pstd}
Parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood estimation using -ml-.

{pstd}
The raw data for use in {bf: hetop_pool} are observed frequency counts of ordered variables for one or more groups across one or more occasions. Let F_gtk be the observed frequency count of observations Y=k for group g on occasion t in category k.

{pstd}
Let the outcome variable observed across groups on occasion t be Y^t. In the HETOP framework we assume that the observed variable Y^t is a coarsened version of an underlying normally distributed continuous variable Y^(*t). 

{pstd} 
The data for {bf: hetop_pool} must be in long form. Each row represents one observed value F_gtk. This is the variable {it:frequency_var}. Let Y^t have K categories, {1,2,...K}. The variable {it:category_var} indicates which category k the observed count is from.

{pstd}

{pstd}
A single "cell" consists of the K rows representing all frequency counts for a single group g on occasion t. The mean and standard deviation of the underlying variable in each cell are the targets of estimation. {bf: hetop_pool} allows you to model the mean and standard deviation of the underlying variable Y^(*t) as a function of covariates. These covariates could be indicator variables for each cell to estimate a unique mean and standard deviation in each cell, or a more parametric model can be specified (e.g., the means or standard deviations are modeled as a linear function of covariates). The covariates are assumed to be constant within cells.

{pstd}
The scale of the estimates is determined by the cutscores provided in {it:kappa}.

{pstd}
Various undocumented options can be passed to {bf: hetop_pool} that will be parsed by -mlopts-.

{pstd}
No checks are conducted by {bf: hetop_pool} as to whether there are sufficient data to identify and estimate the intended parameters specified. This must be established by the user.

{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{phang}
{opt k(varname)}  
This variable indicates which of the K categories the frequency count in the current row represents. 

{phang}
{opt kappa(varname)}  
The variable {it:kappa} contains the known cutscores separating the observed categories of Y^t on the underlying Y^(*t) metric. These are assumed to already be known. There are K-1 cutscores per cell {c_1, c_2, ... c_(K-1)}. The cutscore in the variable {it:kappa} for the row associated with {it: category_var}=k represents the upper (right hand) boundary of category k, except when {it:category_var}=K for which there is no upper boundary, in which case the highest cutscore is repeated from the row for {it: category_var}=(K-1).

{phang}
{opt m:ean(string)}  
An expression indicating a model for the latent means. If omitted a constant-only model estimating a single mean across all cells will be used. 

{phang}
{opt lns:igma(string)}  
An expression indicating a model for the latent standard deviations (technically, a model for ln(SD)). If omitted a constant-only model estimating a single ln(SD) across all cells will be used. 

{phang}
{opt l:evel(cilevel)}  

{phang}
{opt check:by(varname)}  
If supplied, the variable {it:checkby} indicates which set of rows go together to form the set of K values of F_gtk in a single cell.

{phang}
{opt *} 
Specify additional ML options that will be handled by -mlopts-.

{title:Syntax of predict}

{p 4 4}
The syntax of {cmd:predict} following {cmd:hetop_pool} is

{p 8 15 2}{cmd:predict} {it:newvar} , {it:statistic} [ {it:se} ]

{pstd} The predicted values will be stored in the variable {it:newvar}. {it:Note:} the predicted values are constant within each cell and will thus be repeated in the long form data used for estimation.

{pstd}
Where {it:statistic} must be specified and can be 

{p 8 25}{cmd:mean}{space 11}predicted means{p_end}
{p 8 25}{cmd:sigma}{space 10}predicted standard deviations{p_end}

{pstd}
{title:Options for predict}

{p 8 25}{cmd:se}, if specified standard errors for the predictions will be included and saved in the variable {it:newvar_se}{p_end}

{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}

use "hetop_pool-example.dta" , clear

* To estimate a unique mean and standard deviation for each group 
* on each occasion (each "cell"):
hetop_pool y fcount , mean(ibn.cell, nocons) lnsigma(ibn.cell, nocons) ///
	k(k) kappa(kappa)	

* To estimate a model where each cell has a unique mean, 
* but the ln(SD) values are a linear function of the variables "grade" and "year":
hetop_pool y fcount , mean(ibn.cell, nocons) lnsigma(grade year) ///
	k(k) kappa(kappa)	

* After estimation, calculate the model-implied mean (mstar) and SD (sstar) with 
* associated standard errors (mstar_se and sstar_se) for each cell using -predict-:
predict mstar , mean se
predict sstar , sigma se

{title:Stored results}

{pstd}
